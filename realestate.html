<h4>Purchasing and Selling</h4>
<p>
At Knudsen & Simpson, we realize that buying a house or a property can be an extremely stressful, emotional, and exhausting experience. We want to ease your burden. To do this, we educate our clients about every step of the property buying or selling process. In addition, we take all the necessary precautions to make sure that no unexpected situations arise when negotiating land deals. Although every transaction is unique and complicated, we at Knudsen & Simpson strive to make every property purchase or sale run as smoothly and painlessly as possible. </p>

<h4>Foreclosures</h4>
<p>In these tough economic times, foreclosures are unfortunately on the rise. In addition, bank lenders are zealously going after home and condominium owners who may have just a brief lapse in their mortgage payments. We at Knudsen & Simpson negotiate with lenders to help those facing this situation. To do this, we work with lenders to arrange loan modifications, workouts, and in the worst case scenario, negotiate short sales. If you find yourself in this uncertain and stressful situation, we will work tirelessly with your lenders to come to a mutually beneficial resolution, and represent you diligently in the often complicated court process.
