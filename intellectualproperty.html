<h1>Intellectual Property</h1>
<p> Most small businesses do not know the true value of their intellectual property. At Knudsen & Simpson, we advise you on the best ways to recognize your intellectual properties, and then take all the necessary steps to protect and leverage them.

<h1>Trademark</h1>
Every business has a trademark, whether they know it or not. A trademark can be as simple as your business name, or the logo on the products you sell. Protection of these assets is invaluable in growing and maintaining your business. We can also protect you from certain threats you may not realize exist. For example, businesses are often quick to jump into a market without knowing the other fish swimming in the pond. We can identify those threats in advance, and advise you on the best course of action. 

Knudsen & Simpson are also proud to offer our Trademark Guard Service. For a small yearly fee, we will vigilantly police your trademark, taking the responsibility off of you to ensure that someone else or is not infringing upon your rights. This service does all the work for you, so you can get back to work.

<h1>Copyright</h1>
<p>Whether you are a struggling or successful artist, author or musician, your intellectual property is your life blood. In order to protect your livelihood, Knudsen & Simpson knows how to zealously protect your interests. Whether it is managing online infringement, or negotiating a licensing contract, we will take all necessary steps to ensure you receive the best possible outcome.</p>
